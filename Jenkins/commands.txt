key pair : this key is created so you can connect from your computer to this virtual machine you are creating via this 
key pair i.e ssh to ec2 instance(vm)

* After you create the EC2 instance , go to the folder where you have downloaded the ssh-key i.e key pair
and execute the following command :

--- $ssh -i key_name.pem ubuntu@public_ip_address_of_ec2_instance e.g ssh -i key_name.pem ubuntu@13.53.132.127
if it says your key is too open and not too secure then on windows terminal use the following three commands :
---icacls.exe key_name.pem /reset
---icacls.exe key_name.pem /grant:r "$($env:username):(r)"
---icacls.exe key_name.pem /inheritance:r
on ubunto terminal its simple chmod 400 filename.pem .
after that you will enter into your aws ec2 instance now execute the following commands

---sudo apt update

* then in our case to use jenkins we must install java 11 on our ec2 instance(machine) first
--- sudo apt install openjdk-11-jre
--- java --version

* then use the following commands(got from jenkins website)-->link https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/linux/#debianubuntu

sudo wget -O /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key
echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee \
  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install jenkins

* check if jenkins is installed or not use : 
   ---systemctl status jenkins   -->> it will give you a password like this : 516c3c76bb9c4b9aa3e3d63780be291d
We also creaed a new inbound rule i.e added a port 8080 through which we can access jenkins so public ip + port
 i.e 13.53.132.127:8080 -->>to access jenkins

*to change the host name i.e the name on terminal where you add commands.
---sudo hostnamectl set-hostname sonarqube
---/bin/bash

*same as before on the instance of sonarqube do the ---sudo apt update and then install sonarqube on this instance but before that
install java 17 as needed by sonarqube
---sudo apt install openjdk-17-jre 

* Now go to sonarqube website and dont click on the download button on comunity edition but copy the link use this command :
---wget link_paste_here
but but but....the free tier ubunto "t3.micro" with 2vCPU and 1 GiB Memory sonarqube will not work. it works with at least
t3.medium i.e 2CPU and 4 GiB Memory.
