Docker :
        1.client : docker build, docker pull, docker run   -->> a cli where we execute commands
        2.Docker host :  docker daemon , images, containers -->>docker daemon builds your image and save it the registry
        3.Registry(docker hub)
container -->> a running instance of a docker image is called container , every application runs inside a docker container

docker compose : suppose you have multiple applications in various containers and all those containers are linked together so you don't want to run
                 those containers one by one but you want to run them with a single command so that's when docker compose comes into picture. so
                 with docker compose you run multiple applications in various containers with a single command.

suppose we have the following containers 
  1. Web app
  2. Mysql
  3. Redis
 they are all configured in a yaml file which is docker compose file from where you run these containers with a single command.
