kubernetes is a set of machines called nodes.
each node consists of pods and each pod consists of containers.

We can have one node kubernetes cluster or multiple nodes cluster.
Each pod has a unique IP address.

Replica set :  is the back up of your pod. i.e if your pod goes down and not working then you
have its replica which you use

Deployment : are kubernetes objects that are used for managing pods.

secrets and ConfigMap : used to store sensitive informations of your applications. so the best
practice is to store your sensitive informations like password as we write in applications.properties 
file and if we need to change it we rebuild our application and create a new docker image so why 
not we just put those informations in kubernetes secrets and configMap to make our life easier

ETCD : kubernetes uses etcd as a key-value database store. it stores the configuration of the
kubernetes cluster in etcd.
It stores all the secrets and configMap data inside etcd database.
