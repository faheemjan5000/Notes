This is how you call the beanstalk environment. you just call the URL of the Beanstalk and add the port number to it and your endpoint.
but first must add the port number in the security group. so the example is like this : 

http://samplespringthree.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com:8080/call/hello


http://url-from-beanstalk:port/endpoint
