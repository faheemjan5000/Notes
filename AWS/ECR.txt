ECR = elastic container registry.

previously we added our docker image to docker-hub and then pull it inside ECS(elastic container service). but since docker-hub is a public registry
and everyone can access it so we upload our docker container to ECR. i.e amazon provides us a special registry for containers which is ECR where 
we can upload our docker image, so in short ECR is a repository just like Docker-hub where we upload our docker images. and then directly pull them into ECS 
cluster
