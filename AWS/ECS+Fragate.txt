ECS 
Amazon elastic container service
ECS is fully managed container orchestration service

AWS Fargate:
is a serverless compute engine for containers
that works with ECS and it allows you to run
containers without having provision,configure and scaling. it eliminates
the need of EC2 instance. it manages containers, scale up,down etc

        *****************Example*******************************

*first create docker image and push it to docker hub.

from aws open ECS service , from there you can selct amazon Fragate and then inside create a 'task definition' there add the container repository etc from 
docker hub.

after that create the 'cluster'inside the ecs service and add this task definition to it from the drop down list of task definitions.
after its created you can get the public ip address from it and it the port number to it to access your docker image i.e endpoints of ur application.
