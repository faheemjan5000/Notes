Helm is a package manager for kubernetes.
It visualize the application as a package where all the dependencies will be packed together and the entire package can be shared and
can be deployed into the kubernetes cluster.
It facilitates to upgrade and rollback the changes by maintaining the versions.
It handles the complete life cycle of the application(create,install,upgrade,Rollback,Delete,status,Versioning).
It can manage multiple environments with the same template. it manages any complex environment.

untill now what we did is we created deployment.yaml and service.yaml files for creating deployment and service for a specific docker image
e.g nginx,mysql etc

in helm if we wanna get a deployment and service for lets say nginx or mysql or any other public images we must go to the helm hub
and from there read the instruction for creating(installing) deployment and service for each specific images.
for example for mysql we install it using this commmand:
helm install --->>> it installs a chart e.g
helm install stable/mysql --generate-name -->> it installs mysql chart ... these are all public charts. 

we will create our own custom charts from the scratch using the command
helm create chartName.
